# 原文

多年后，后人们提起：

己亥末，庚子春

荆楚大疫，染者数万，众惶恐，举国防，皆闭户

 道无车舟，万巷空寂

然外狼亦动，垂涎而候，华夏腹背芒刺

幸龙魂不死，风雨而立

医无私，警无畏，民齐心

政者，医者，兵者，扛鼎逆行勇战矣

商客，名家，百姓，仁义者，邻邦献物捐资

叹山川异域，风月同天，岂曰无衣，与子同裳

能者竭力，万民同心

月余，疫除，终胜

此后百年，风调雨顺，国泰民安

# 翻译

Many years later, posterity will mention,

At the end of Jihai and the beginning of Gengzi,

a severe plague broke out in Jingchu so that tens of thousands of people was infected.

People were frightened. The whole nation defended it and all the people closed their doors and

windows.

No car in the street, either boat in the river. All of the streets were empty.

However, foreigners were in action with covetous  eyes. China was between Scylla and

Charybdis.

Fortunately, the soul of dragon was immortal and stood up against the wind and rain.

Medical workers were selfless to help others, policemen were fearless to keep order and the

people were of one mind to defend virus.

Governors, doctors and soldiers shouldering the heavy burden to fight against infection.

Traders, famous persons and common people were kind to donate important material.

Although we are not in the same place, we all share wind and admire the moon. Don‘t be

afraid of not having enough clothes to resist the cold, because we can share them with you.

Able persons tried their best to offer help and all the people were of one mind.

Several months later, as a result, the epidemic was removed and we won.

Hundreds of years after then, the wind and rain are on time as well as  the country is

prosperous and the people are at peace.
